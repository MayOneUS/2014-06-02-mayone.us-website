mayoneus.github.io is the live website. This fork is a staging area available via
[mayoneus-testing.github.io](http://mayoneus-testing.github.io). Changes should be 
committed here first, checked to make sure they're good at [http://mayoneus-testing.github.io/](http://mayoneus-testing.github.io/), and then merged into

Local Testing
=============
If you're making a trickier change, you may want to run jekyll locally so you 
don't have to push to see your changes.

Ruby must be installed on your system, as well as the version of Jekyll used by GitHub Pages: `gem install github-pages`

Simply run `jekyll serve --watch` and visit http://localhost:4000/
