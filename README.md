This is the git repo for the static site http://mayoneus.github.io. Pushing here
publishes changes immediately, so think before you commit!

Previewing changes before pushing
=================================
You can either run Jekyll on your local machine to preview the site (see below), or
you can fork the repository and set it up as your own user page (unfortunately, you
can't make it a project page, because the URLs get messed up). 

I'll probably set up an official branch we can use as a staging area.

Local Testing
=============
Ruby must be installed on your system, as well as Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`

Running a Local Instance
------------------------
Simply run `jekyll serve --watch` and visit http://localhost:4000/
