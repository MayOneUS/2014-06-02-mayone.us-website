<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jimgreer-e1398802792483.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-653" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jimgreer-e1398802792483.jpg" alt="jimgreer" width="160" height="186"></a>

## Mark McKinnon — Board Member, Treasurer

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MarkMcKinnonSquare.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-624" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MarkMcKinnonSquare.jpg" alt="MarkMcKinnonSquare" width="150" height="150"></a>

Mark McKinnon is an award-winning media producer and communications strategist
who has served as principal media advisor for hundreds of corporate and
political campaigns around the world. McKinnon has helped engineer five winning
presidential primary and general elections. He has been awarded more than 30
Pollie and Telly awards, honoring the nation’s best political and public
affairs advertising.

According to Broadcasting and Cable magazine, McKinnon is one of “a handful of
players behind every big decision, consensus or roadblock in Washington…putting
a unique, sometimes hidden stamp on the outcome of today’s debates.” Politics
Daily writes: “He’s known for his originality in a field typified by copy-cats,
a mellow personality in a world populated with high-strung brutes, and
ecumenical urges in a profession dominated by its unadulterated partisans.”

“McKinnon is evidence that principled centrism is not an oxymoron,” wrote John
Avalon in a Daily Beast column about the 25 Best Centrist Pundits. “McKinnon
piloted John McCain’s 2008 primary campaign to victory. But he announced in
advance that if Barack Obama won the democratic nomination, he would ride off
into the sunset rather than participate in the negative attacks he knew would
be required. This is unheard of in the world of modern politics, where
partisanship trumps principle as a matter of course.”

Former President George W. Bush says of McKinnon, “I was really impressed by
Mark’s creativity, and I was particularly impressed by his honesty.” Senator
John McCain, in his typical straight-talk fashion, remarks, “He’s almost a
genius.” And President Barack Obama calls McKinnon “a class act.”

McKinnon is co-founder of No Labels, a non-profit organization dedicated to
bipartisanship, civil discourse and problem solving in politics, and is
co-chair of Arts+Labs, a collaboration between technology and creative
communities that have embraced today’s rich internet environment to deliver
innovative and creative digital products to consumers. President Bush appointed
McKinnon to serve as a governor of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. He
currently serves on the boards of the Lance Armstrong Foundation and Change
Congress, an organization dedicated to campaign finance reform, and has taught
at the JFK School of Government at Harvard University and the LBJ School of
Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.

McKinnon attended the University of Texas at Austin and served as editor of the
award-winning university newspaper, The Daily Texan. He spent several years in
Nashville working as a songwriter with Kris Kristofferson (and was wildly
unsuccessful). McKinnon also is a two-time Ironman finisher. His quality of
life is exceptionally enhanced by the enduring love and patience of his wife,
Annie (whom he met before he could drive), and his daughters, Brita, 26, and
Kendall, 24.
