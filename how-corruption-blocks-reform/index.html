style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim.html" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><h2>Overview:Â A Problem of Incentives.</h2><p>We have a problem in this country: The incentive system for our politicians is broken. We have a representative democracy &#8211; a Republic &#8211; because the Founders and Framers believed, quite sincerely, that the only way to keep politicians in line was to keep them accountable to the public. To that end, they created anÂ <em>incentive system.</em> We call it &#8220;voting.&#8221;</p><div
class="pullquote" style="float: right;">95% of the candidates that out-spent their opponents won a congressional House seat in 2012.</div><p>When it comes down to it, that&#8217;s all voting is, really. Do a good job, keep the people happy, and you get another term in office &#8211; and the perks of seniority. Do poorly and make the people unhappy, and you will be replaced. Simple, and until recently, mostly effective.</p><p>What has happened, however, is that over the centuries and especially in the past few decades, a different incentive &#8211; a competing or conflicting incentive, if you will, has arisen. More and more, we see that the biggest factor in getting elected or re-elected is the amount of money a candidate raises. 95% of the candidates that out-spent their opponents won a congressional House seat in 2012; and the other 5% still had to raise a significant amount to remain competitive.</p><p>So more and more, candidates and elected officials are <em>incentivized</em>Â to keep the funders of their campaigns happy, first. And this incentive has become too strong, relative to the vote. Congress was elected to serve the people, but they are forced to serve the funders.</p><h3>Game of Phones</h3><p>Here&#8217;s a sobering fact: Congresspeople and candidates for Congress spend anywhere from 30-70% of thier timeÂ <em>in session</em> on the phone, fundraising. They&#8217;re not making policies or governing, they&#8217;re just <em>raising money.</em>Â And they&#8217;re not spending that time fundraising from a broad cross-section of Americans; they spend that time raising money from &#8220;deep pockets.&#8221;</p><div
class="pullquote" style="float: left;">&#8220;The one question you have to ask when you are deciding whether to run for Congress is, are you willing to become a telemarketer for 24 months?&#8221;<br
/> âSen. Chris Murphy</div><p>About 150,000 people in the U.S. &#8211; about 0.05% of the population &#8211; are significant funders of political campaigns. Now, there are some sweet funders out there who really want to do good. And you may even agree with some of those funders. But for the most part, those who fund campaigns are doing so not to advance the public interest, (which is the purpose of Congress), but to advanceÂ <em>private interests. </em></p><p>It would be different if candidates raised money from a broader group of people that more generally represented the public, but because there are so few significant funders, it does not take many people to use their influence to block reforms that serve the public interest, but which would be bad for their private interests.</p><p>And the issues Congress chooses to address, and the solutions that Congress considers, are almost always for the benefit of the funders, not of the public.</p><h3>The System of Corruption</h3><p>This is a <em>system</em> of corruption. Corruption may carry loaded connotations and imagery of unmarked paper bags filled wish cash, but that&#8217;s not the type of corruption we&#8217;re talking about. Systemic corruption is, at its most basic, the idea that Congress was created to serve the public, and it no longer does so. It has been warped and twisted.</p><div
class="pullquote" style="float: left;">&#8220;This system makes good people do bad things.â¦ All of our ideals are sacrificed. We are all corrupted. I know this is a harsh judgement, but it is a fair one.&#8221;<br
/> âSen. John McCain</div><p>And this system of corruption is not the fault of any one actor. It is not a moral failing that causes politicians to be corrupt, but the fact that there is no alternative than toÂ <em>become</em> corrupt. As a result, even the most saintly of politicians will succumb to the needs of fundraising in order to do &#8220;the most good they can working within the system they have.&#8221;</p><p>But that system has enabled crony capitalists and special interests to work against both the political Left and the political Right. The same dysfunction that prevents the Left from getting a decent healthcare plan also prevents the Right from getting lower taxes and less regulation.</p><h3>It&#8217;s not Left v. Right. It&#8217;s Inside v. Outside.</h3><div
class="pullquote" style="float: right;">The image of Americans that is reflected back to us by our political and media process is false. It is us through a fun-house mirrorâ¦ We hear every damn day about howâ¦ itâs a shame that we canât work together to get things done, but the truth is we do. We work together to get things done every damn day.<br
/> âJon Stewart</div><p>One of the side-effects of this system of corruption is the hyper-polarization in our current political discourse. In order to encourage donors &#8211; both large and small &#8211; to continue to produce campaign checks, both political parties use the other as a &#8220;boogyman&#8221; who must be stopped &#8211; and then ask for a check to fund the war effort. But if you can take a step back from the wedge issues and the rhetoric,Â <em>mostÂ </em>of what the Republicans want, the Democrats wouldn&#8217;t have a problem with, and vice versa. There will always be irreconcilable differences, but no Democrat wants to pay more in taxes, and no Republican wants to drink foul water. Maybe we disagree on the priorities, but we agree on the principles.</p><p>But we can&#8217;t even get the reforms we would agree with passed; again, because the true division isn&#8217;t between the Left and the Right. It&#8217;s between the &#8220;inside&#8221; &#8211; the political insiders and funders who fight to keep a stranglehold on influence in Washington, and the outside &#8211; the rest of us who can only progress by working together to solve our problems.</p><h3>Bleak, yes, but here&#8217;s why we&#8217;ll win.</h3><p>So, perhaps I&#8217;ve convinced you that our Republic has been lost, that our votes are worthless because the funders can block any real reform. What I hope to convince you now is that this is a winnable battle. <em><strong>Please, please, please, get angry about this, but do not let that lead to despair and inaction</strong>.</em>Â  The only reason why this problem seems insolvable is because weÂ <em>think</em> it&#8217;s insolvable. 96% of Americans want to reduce the influence of money in politics, but 91% believe that doing so isn&#8217;t possible within their lifetimes.</p><p>This is actually aÂ <em>simple problem to solve</em> and we&#8217;ve got advantages that few have yet to consider.</p><h4>Advantage 1: It&#8217;s a simple problem with practical solutions.</h4><div
class="pullquote" style="float: right;">I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility. But I don&#8217;t buy it.â¦ This is a problem of just incentives. Change the incentives, and the behavior changes. The states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen, overnight, a change in practices.<br
/> âProf. Lawrence Lessig.</div><p>First of all, if the problem is one of incentives, all we have to do to fix the system is toÂ <em>repair the incentives.</em>Â  If Congress&#8217;s duty is to serve the people, but their incentives are to serve the funders, we simplyÂ <em>make the citizens the funders.</em>Â  We can do this through citizen-funded elections &#8211; publicly funded elections which are opt-in for both citizens and candidates, where no citizens&#8217; tax dollars are spent on speech that citizen would not support. Politicians would only have access to these funds if they agreed to abide by restrictions, such as accepting no more than a small amount from individual donors. Such a system would be fair, free, and most importantly, provide aÂ <em>viable alternative</em> to the current system of private fundraising we have now.</p><h4>Advantage 2: We may get help from unlikely sources: the politicians.</h4><p>The need to constantly dial-for-dollars is almost certainly any Congressman&#8217;s least favorite part of their job. Given the option, candidates and officeholders will likely ditch the glorified telemarketing they have to do in order to focus on doing what they ran for Congress to do in the first place. (How do we know this? We know this because on the state level, when Connecticut instituted citizen-funded elections, 78% of all politicians opted-in.)</p><p>If we can show Congress that there is a real solid base of Americans who are informed, andÂ more importantly, active, that might be all the &#8220;political cover&#8221; they need to revolt against the funders and work with us towards reform. (This is one of the reasons our goals with May One are so ambitious &#8211; to show the magnitude of the latent, pent-up demand for reform.)</p><h4>Advantage 3: Every activist is an anti-corruption activist.</h4><p>As we know, this system of corruption blocks reform on almost every issue (minus some &#8220;wedge social issues&#8221;) that every American faces. Which means that our potential pool of anti-corruption reformers consist of <em>every</em> politically aware and active person in the United States, whether the issue they&#8217;re most passionate about is taxes or food safety or jobs or defense or net neutrality, etc. The key is convincing them that no matter whattheir most passionate, most important issue is to them, they are being blocked on that issue by the system of corruption and therefore must solve this issue first.</p><h4>Advantage 4: Opposition is not organized.</h4><p>Pro-reform groups may have different approaches and different solutions, but we are all working towards the same goal. Those who perpetuate the system of corruption are often working at cross-purposes. The amounts of money they spend on campaign finance may be massive, but they&#8217;re not spending that moneyÂ <em>for the express purpose of propping up corruption. </em>That&#8217;s just a side-effect. They are interested in promoting theirÂ <em>private interests.</em> AndÂ individual actors with private interests aren&#8217;t going to siphon money away from promoting those private interests in order to fight reformers off. Indeed, some funders who actively and knowingly participate in this corrupt system know how destructive it is &#8211; but just like the politicians, they feel there&#8217;s no other way to succeed than to participate.</p><p>Additionally, many of the funders work at cross-purposes. Telecommunications companies fight against cable companies for preferential treatment, insurance companies compete with pharmaceutical companies for the price of pills.</p><p>Indeed, there is no real organized opposition to reform; our biggest obstacle is convincing those 91% that this is a solvable problem.</p><h3>The odds are irrelevant.</h3><p>Okay. But even if you&#8217;re not yet with us, even if you believe this is impossible, that is irrelevant. <EM>Irrelevant.</EM> Imagine a doctor coming to you and saying that a loved one has terminal brain cancer, and there&#8217;s nothing you can do. Would you do nothing? Would you just sit there and accept it?  Hell no. You would do everything you could. That&#8217;s what love means. You do whatever the hell you can, odds be damned.</p><p>And though we may be frustrated with our government, deep down, we all love this country.</p></div> </article><div
