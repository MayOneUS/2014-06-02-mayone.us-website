&quot;&#8230;a citizens' funded and crowdsourced superPAC
<span style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'sans';">&mdash;</span>
to end all superPACs&quot;

{% endcapture %}


{% capture the_idea_text %}

Government has failed us. More than 90% of Americans link that failure
to the influence of money in politics.

Yet the politicians do not talk about this influence. While America founders[*](#meaning_of_founders),
they spend endless time with their funders.

These funders hold our democracy hostage. **We want to pay the ransom,
and get it back.**

***We're going to kickstart a SuperPAC big enough to make it possible
to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.***

Or at least we're going to try.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture to_kickstart_text %}

This Citizens' SuperPAC will be funded through a series of contingent pledges:

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
We will set funding goals.

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
**We will only collect if we hit our goals.**

The idea is simple: Unless there’s enough to make a difference, you don’t pay.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture y2014_text %}

In 2014, we want to make fundamental reform the issue in **5 congressional
races**.

From that, we'll have a better sense of what victory in 2016 will take. And
we'll put Congress on notice that in 2016, we'll be back.

So for 2014, we have two fundraising targets:

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
***The first is $1 million by the end of May. If we meet that goal, that $1
million will be matched, and we'll move to the second target.***

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
***That second target is $5 million by the end of June. If we meet that goal,
that $5 million will also be matched, and our fundraising for 2014 will end.***

We will then have the funds we need to hire the best campaign shops we can to
use 100% of these kickstarted funds to win in these 5 districts.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture y2016_text %}

Over the past year, we have been calculating what it would cost to win a
Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. We have a good sense of the
range, and of which seats would need to change.

Our experience in 2014 will give us a better sense. And based on what we learn,
we will decide whether this moonshot is feasible.

If it is, in January 2015, *then we will launch the second round of the Mayday
PAC*, crowdfunding small-dollar contributions to fund a superPAC big enough to
win a majority in Congress in 2016 committed to [fundamental
reform](http://reform.to/#/about).

Based on what we know now, we believe this
[moonshot](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/)
is possible. Based on what we achieve in 2014, others will believe it as well.
