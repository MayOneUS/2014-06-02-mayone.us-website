Government has failed us. More than 90% of Americans link that failure
to the influence of money in politics.

Yet the politicians ignore this influence. While America founders,
they spend endless time with their funders.

These funders hold our democracy hostage. **We want to pay the ransom,
and get it back.**

***We're going to kickstart a SuperPAC big enough to make it possible
to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.***

Or at least we're going to try.
