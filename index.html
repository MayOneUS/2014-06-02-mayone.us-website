&quot;&#8230;a citizens' funded and crowdsourced superPAC
<span style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'sans';">&mdash;</span>
to end all superPACs&quot;

{% endcapture %}


{% capture the_idea_text %}

Government has failed us. More than 90% of Americans link that failure
to the influence of money in politics.

Yet the politicians ignore this influence. While America founders,
they spend endless time with their funders.

These funders hold our democracy hostage. **We want to pay the ransom,
and get it back.**

***We're going to kickstart a SuperPAC big enough to make it possible
to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.***

Or at least we're going to try.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture to_kickstart_text %}

This Citizens' SuperPAC will be funded through a series of contingent pledges:

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
We will set funding goals.

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
**We will only collect if we hit our goals.**

The idea is simple: Unless there’s enough to make a difference, you don’t pay.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture y2014_text %}

In 2014, we want to make fundamental reform the issue in **5 congressional
races**.

From that, we'll have a better sense of what victory in 2016 will take. And
we'll put Congress on notice that in 2016, we'll be back.

So for 2014, we have two fundraising targets:

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
***The first is $1 million by the end of May. If we meet that goal, that $1
million will be matched, and we'll move to the second target.***

{: style="padding-left:25px;"}
***That second target is $5 million by the end of June. If we meet that goal,
that $5 million will also be matched, and our fundraising for 2014 will end.***

We will then have the funds we need to hire the best campaign shops we can to
use 100% of these kickstarted funds to win in these 5 districts.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture y2016_text %}

Over the past year, we have been calculating what it would cost to win a
Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. We have a good sense of the
range, and of which seats would need to change.

Our experience in 2014 will give us a better sense. And based on what we learn,
we will decide whether this moonshot is feasible.

If it is, in January 2015, *then we will launch the second round of the Mayday
PAC*, crowdfunding small-dollar contributions to fund a superPAC big enough to
win a majority in Congress in 2016 committed to [fundamental
reform](http://reform.to/#/about).

Based on what we know now, we believe this
[moonshot](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/)
is possible. Based on what we achieve in 2014, others will believe it as well.
