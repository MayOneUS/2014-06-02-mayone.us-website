###[LA Times: Harvard professor's 'super PAC' aims to end power of 'super PACs'](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-harvard-professor-super-pac-big-money-politics-20140523-story.html)
>  Is it possible to create a "super PAC" that would end the power of super PACs by drawing enough Americans into the system to limit the influence of big money in politics? And is it possible to get voters excited about a subject as dry as campaign finance?  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is leading a crusade to answer both those questions with a yes.

>  If the Mayday PAC is able to take out five members of Congress this cycle “who are on the wrong side of this issue,” Lessig said, “then when 2016 comes around, magically a whole bunch of members of Congress would be on the right side of this issue, and we would have a narrower range of people that we would have to be going after, and we would have very good data

###[The Huffington Post: The Super PAC To End All Super PACs Gets Off To A Super Start](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/15/mayone-lawrence-lessig_n_5333020.html)

> WASHINGTON -- On May 1, Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig launched what he calls 
  a "super PAC to end all super PACs."  Lessig, one of a new breed of campaign 
  finance reformers, wants to change the corrupted system by which politicians 
  now raise money for their campaigns.

> The irony is to get money out of politics, reformers must raise money of their own. 
  On that measure, Lessig's new     organization has gotten off to a super start.

> Just when you were fed up with our petty, craven politics and were ready to
  write off the next few years as a circus of filibusters, gridlock and
  investigations, comes an idea so simple yet subversive that it offers a
  glorious ray of hope.

> Call it [Lawrence Lessig's](http://www.lessig.org/) "money bomb."  It’s an
  ingenious plan to make the drive for small-dollar publicly funded elections a
  central issue in 2016. With a little luck, the Harvard law professor’s idea
  could help save the republic.

> Harvard’s Lawrence Lessig, the crusader for campaign finance reform, feels
  that his fellow reformers don’t think big or boldly enough to inspire the kind
  of grassroots campaign that might break elite donors’ stranglehold on
  America’s political system.

> In a recent piece in [*The
  Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/),
  Lessig argues that public cynicism about the prospect of deep reform actually
  working is the only thing keeping widespread outrage at our slide toward
  plutocracy in check. And he thinks that only a “moonshot” campaign — an
  ambitious, collective, national effort “unlike anything they’ve seen before” —
  can “crack this cynicism” and usher in a more democratic system.

> Mayday PAC was already 8 percent of the way toward its goal by Thursday
  afternoon with more than $75,000 pledged and nearly 31 days left to reach its
  target.

> To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of
  serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the
  Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking
  down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political
  spending.

> If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that’s by design. Cynicism and
  defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig
  believes, that the only way to “crack this cynicism” is with an idea so
  exceedingly ambitious—a “moonshoot,” he calls it—that people might be roused
  to get behind it.

> “We must show Americans something unlike anything they’ve seen before,”

  at Princeton and Northwestern universities found that, and I’m quoting
  directly here: “When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of
  organized interest groups are controlled for,&nbsp;<em>the preferences of the

  non-significant impact</em>&nbsp;upon public policy.”
