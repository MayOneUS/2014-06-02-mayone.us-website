## I’ve pledged, but now what?

**_Share._** The single most important thing you can do now is to share this
site and the message and the idea. You can tweet, facebook, or blog the
campaign using the social media markers on the main page, just under the Pledge
Now button. Be sure to use the name of the site, MayOne.us, and the hashtag
#MaydayPAC.

If you have a blog or website, add our widget by including this code in your site:

<a name="share_email" id="share_email"></a> The next step toward making the
Mayday super PAC successful is reaching out to friends, neighbors, and
colleagues, and *expanding* our reach. Can you help by sending a message to
your network about this campaign?

There are easy ways to do this —like *sharing* on Twitter and Facebook — but
the most impactful way is through a personal e-mail message. Here’s an
example:

> Giving money to a super PAC is one of the last things I thought I’d ever do…
but I just did.

> I recently joined Lawrence Lessig’s citizen-funded Mayday PAC, an ambitious
campaign to win a Congress committed to ending corruption in 2016, and today we
did something amazing: we reached the halfway mark for our fundraising goal
with over $500,000 in pledges. That’s a ton of money, but it’s not enough.
We’ve got $500,000 more to raise, and I’m writing to my friends and family to
ask if you can help us get the rest of the way there. If all of us who have
supported the Mayday PAC so far each recruit just one matching donation, we’d
easily hit that goal. But I’d like to see if I can recruit five of my friends
to donate. So my question is: will you be one of those five?

> I don’t have to tell you why this is important. We all know our government is
dismally dysfunctional because politicians spend all their time raising money
instead of doing the jobs they were elected to do. So our plan is to fight fire
with fire: raise the money needed to elect representatives that are committed
to the reform we so desperately need.

> You can read all about the Mayday PAC via the links below, but once you do,
please consider joining me in making a pledge. This is a totally crazy plan,
but now that we’ve raised $500,000 I’m beginning to think: it’s so crazy that
it just might work. It’d mean the world to have your support.

> Yours, (Your name here)

### What more beyond *sharing*?

Create and pester.

*Create:* Tell your story. Tell this story. Explain to your friends why this
issue matters. And through that telling, you will help us understand how to
make it more compelling. Use the #MaydayPAC hashtag, and again, be
sure to share what you’ve created with us and with your friends.

*Pester:* We will win only when we have a majority in Congress committed to
fundamental reform. If you go to [reform.to](http://reform.to), you can see
where your representatives stand on fundamental reform. If they’re on the wrong
side, pester them to get on the right side. And if you convert someone, let us
know.

I can’t stress this enough: Only by sending personal appeals to the people in
your support networks, online and off, will we reach people, especially those
who desperately want to fix the problems that the influence of money in
politics causes, but have become so cynical they dare not get their hopes up.
Tell them what we’ve accomplished so far – and what we hope to accomplish. But
most importantly, let them know that their support is extremely important to
**you.**

## Can I sign up to volunteer online?

Yes! This Google Form will take your name, e-mail and zip code, and we’ll add
you to our volunteer database.

## What about offline?

Spread the word, face to face. Talk to people in your social groups, your
clubs, and ask them to out MayOne.us. Get people together and organized working
for change. Contact your local Congressman and tell them that you want
legislation that provides for citizen-funded elections, and if they’re not
receptive, let people know.

## I’m creative/smart/talented – can I help?

Damn straight. On this page, we’ll keep a list of our current needs. But beyond
the specifics, we’re keen to find material we can share with others. If you’re
an artist, we’d love to get your photography, sketches, videos, and animations.
If you’re a programmer, we’d love to see what creative apps you can come
up with to help us spread the word and get organized. If you can upload
your work digitally, just be sure to tag it #MaydayPAC, and send an e-mail to
[info@mayone.us](mailto:info@mayone.us).

## I’m not an American, but I want to help.

If you’re not a citizen or permanent resident of the U.S., unfortunately you
cannot pledge or give any item of value. However, if you want to spread the
word, please do so. And remember – the issues we fight for here are issues in
every democracy. Be sure to get informed and involved locally.

## What help do you need now?

Here’s a list of the things we need — work, stuff, ideas, etc. This list will
evolve, so check back often. If you have something, email us at
[info@mayone.us](mailto:info@mayone.us).

* Iconic images of America — for the opening screen, compelling, color images
of America, freely licensed ideally.

* Haunting images of America — for the opening screen, images that evoke a sense
of what America needs.

* Technical support — we’ve had incredible volunteer support, and need
more.
