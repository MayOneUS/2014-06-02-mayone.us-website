The Mayday PAC values your privacy. You join our movement for a specific
purpose. We will not use your personal information in a way that is
inconsistent with that purpose.

What follows is our Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, or concerns,
please contact us at info@mayone.us:

* For anyone making a contribution or a pledge to contribute to the Mayday PAC,
we must collect the personal information necessary for F.E.C. reporting. We
will never sell, rent, share or distribute that information to anyone, except
to the F.E.C.

* We also collect user information, consisting of names, email addresses,
zipcodes, and, potentially, cellphone numbers and social media identifiers.
We will never sell, rent, share or distribute that information to anyone,
except with *express* permission from you, or as described in the next
paragraph.

* We sometimes partner with other political action organizations. If you
provide user information to us after being referred to us by such a partner,
we may share that information with the referring site. We will never partner
with any organization that is less protective of the privacy of their users
than we are.

* We collect and store user information for login purposes and in order to stay
in touch with you.

* Except to the extent required by the F.E.C., you can remove yourself and your
user information from our systems whenever you want.

* We collect analytics about how people use our site. We use that information
to improve the site, and we will sometimes share usage information with
reporters, funders and others. But we only share that information at an
aggregate level; we never share information about individual users.
